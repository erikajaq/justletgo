                    Create 5 separate columns with
                    the following headers: Issue, Blame,
                    Consequence, Oppurtunity and Fix. In the first column, Issue, write unresolved situations in your life. This could possibly include things from your past that you havenâ€™t let go of, problems that are occurring right now, issues that involve other people, or situations that exist within your own experience. In the second column, Blame, determine and name who you are blaming for these issues. In the third column, Consequence, identify what you believe the consequences may be of leaving these issues unresolved. For example, if you have unresolved tension with your sibling this may cause you to dread spending time with your family. In the fourth column, Opportunity, list what possible results of letting go of these past issues may be - more energy, the ability to move on, etc. Finally, in the fifth column, Fix, list actions you can take to resolve this issue in the future and move forward.

                  List every problem you may have with a particular person, several
                  persons, or situation that hurt you. After doing that consider how you may have contributed to each problem.

                Write out the painful, harmful, or destructive thoughts that come into your head throughout the day. Now, imagine them being said in a cartoon voice. This gives the thoughts less power and agency, and allows you to see how from a different perspective, some of your thoughts and fears may be unfounded, or less vast than you may have thought.
