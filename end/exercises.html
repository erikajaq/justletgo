                          Create 5 separate columns with
                          the following headers: Issue, Blame,
                          Consequence, Oppurtunity and Fix. In the first column, Issue, write unresolved situations in your life. This could possibly include things from your past that you haven’t let go of, problems that are occurring right now, issues that involve other people, or situations that exist within your own experience. In the second column, Blame, determine and name who you are blaming for these issues. In the third column, Consequence, identify what you believe the consequences may be of leaving these issues unresolved. For example, if you have unresolved tension with your sibling this may cause you to dread spending time with your family. In the fourth column, Opportunity, list what possible results of letting go of these past issues may be - more energy, the ability to move on, etc. Finally, in the fifth column, Fix, list actions you can take to resolve this issue in the future and move forward.

                        List every problem you may have with a particular person, several
                        persons,<br>
                         or situation that hurt you. After doing that consider how you may have contributed to each problem.

                      <div id="title">Exercise 5</div><br>
                      Pick up a physical object, mark a piece of paper, or collect something (any form of documention will work) everytime you experience feelings of anger, resentment, or hurt for a week-long period. At the end of the week, see how much “weight” you’ve documented yourself carrying.

                  <div id="seven">
                    <div id="title">Exercise 7</div><br>
                    When you experience feelings of
                    anger, sadness, or hurt try to pinpoint the exact thing or situation that triggered those feelings. Be as specific as possible and write them down.

                <div id="nine">
                  <div id="title">Exercise 9</div><br>
                  Take a situation you fear and write it down. Then question it by asking<br>
                   “and then what?” Write down your answer and continue to ask “and then what” for each question. For example: If you fear your significant other flirting with someone, the answer to “and then what?” may be that you fear<br>
                    if they flirt with someone else they may become attracted to that person, and then the answer to the next “and the what?” may be that you fear they will choose this person over you, and then the next answer may be that you fear you are not good enough for your significant other and they will leave you, and then the next may be that they never actually loved you, that you are unlikeable, that you will never find love, etc. With each answer you come up with, write down an argument that disproves this answer. For example:
                  my significant other is with me because they want to be with me, you are worthy and deserving of love, etc.

                <div id="title">Exercise 2</div><br>
                Write out the painful, harmful, or destructive thoughts that come into your head throughout the day. Now, imagine them being said in a cartoon voice. This gives the thoughts less power and agency, and allows you to see how from a different perspective, some of your thoughts and fears may be unfounded, or less vast than you may have thought.

          </div>

          <div id="four">
            <div id="title">Exercise 4</div><br>
            List all of your stresses and fears - then follow this line of questioning:<br>
             What exactly do you tend to feel insecure about? What uncertainties exist that make you feel insecure? What worries or fears make you feel insecure? Why are you feeling insecure about those things? What underlying irrational beliefs are at the core of the insecurities? What unhelpful thinking styles are at the heart of these beliefs? Until finally, you are able to ask: What is the root cause of all these insecurities? You may often find the same root insecurities popping up multiple times.

          <div id="six">
            <div id="title">Exercise 6</div><br>
            Think of a thought or person that has hurt you. Take time to focus on how the thought makes you feel mentally, physically, and emotionally rather than focusing on the thought or person itself. Visualize your thoughts as colors and picture them fading away the less attention you give them. Whenever you have a negative thought, think of this thought as an energy or color rather than the images generated by the thought. You can take away the agency of the negative thoughts this way.

          <div id="eight">
            <div id="title">Exercise 8</div><br>
            Make three columns labled “The What,” “The Who,” and “The Why.”<br>
             In the “What” column, write a problem you have that has caused you<br>
              to feel hurt. In the “Who” column, identify who made you feel this way<br>
               (the answer can be yourself!) In the “Why” column identify exactly why <br>
               what they did hurt you. When you are done with your list, go through<br>
                each grouping and try to identify the root insecurity.

            <div id="title">Exercise 10</div><br>
            Make a “self-esteem” file - document anything positive someone<br>
             says to you about you. Write it all down.
