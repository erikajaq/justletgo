      <div class="poem">
        Every day I am born like this—<br>
        No chingues. Nothing happens<br>
        for the first time. Not the neon<br>
        sign that says vacant, not the men<br>
        nor the jackals who resemble them.<br>
        I take my bones inscribed by those <br>
        who came before, and learn <br>
        to court myself under a violence <br>
        of stars. I prefer to become demon, <br>
        what their eyes cannot. Half of me <br>
        is beautiful, half of me is a promise <br>
        filled with the quietest places. <br>
        Every day I pray like a dog <br>
        in the mirror and relish the crux <br>
        of my hurt. We know Lilith ate <br>
        the bones of her enemies. We know <br>
        a bitch learns to love her own ghost. <br><br>
        -Erika L. Sánchez, <i> All of Us</i>
