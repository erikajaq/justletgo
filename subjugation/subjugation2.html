          <div class="container">
            You feel the need to please your loved ones, friends, colleagues, and even strangers. You do not want to be a nuissance, but rather nice and easy to handle, so you agree to things that do not seem to be particularly important to you. You find it difficult to stand for yourself in both small and large matters. You let others control you because you want to avoid unpleasant consequences and situations. You do not openly express your needs, because you do not believe they are important enough. You hide your anger to evade a conflict. The supression of your anger leads to an accumulation inside of you. You may attract people who are dominant and bossy who will decide for you how you should act, behave, and feel.<br>
