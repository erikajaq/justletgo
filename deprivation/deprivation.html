            At your root, you have a feeling of being chronically disappointed in others. As a result of past relationships, you feel you cannot count on people to be there for you emotionally. You feel others will let you down. It is a sad and heavy sense of knowledge. Because you have faced so much emotion deprivation in your life, you find it frightening to make yourself vulnerable to others and ask for what you need. You protect yourself from closeness by choosing partners who are unavailable, or those who are physically present, but mentally cold and ungiving. By doing this, you perpetuate your sense of feeling neglected. No matter where you turn, you encounter deprivation. You have become invested in keeping yourself invulnerable in close relationships to protext yourself from disappointment. To avoid the hurt of the deprivation you have felt in your life, you focus on how others have let you down and disappointed you.
