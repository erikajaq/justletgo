          <a href="http://www.just-let-go.com/paranoid/paranoid5">  You have a vigilant mistrust of others and an egdy defensiveness. You believe others are neglectful of your well-being, and that they are out to deceive you. You are eternally afraid of being deceived or being suckered into relationships where you may lose your power of self-determination, you are constantly suspicious, mistrustful, and guarded towards others. Because of your never-ending guardedness, you tend to misread the intentions of others - responding with anger to what you perceive as deception.
