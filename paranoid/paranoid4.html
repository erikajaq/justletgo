            You have a vigilant mistrust <br>of others and an egdy defensiveness. You believe others are neglectful of your well-being, and that they are out to deceive you. You are eternally afraid of being deceived or being suckered into relationships where you <br>may lose your power of <br>self-determination, you <br>are constantly suspicious, mistrustful, and guarded towards others. Because of <br>your never-ending guardedness, you tend to misread the intentions of others - responding with anger to <br>what you perceive as deception.<br>
