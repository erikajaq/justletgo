            You attract people by presenting yourself as either one of of two personas, or a combination of both: extremely hardworking and giving, or  extremely entertaining and charming. You feel that if you do not present yourself in this way, you will not be noticed or given attention to. At the same time, you detest others for making you feel that you have to put on an act to receive basic love and validation. You alternate between being extremely sensitive to others and completely neglectful of them. You switch between seeking intense intimacy, and creating artificial borders between you and others. You have a deep-seated fear that people will only like you for the personas you put on, rather than loving you as you are.
