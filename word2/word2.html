        What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why, <br>
        I have forgotten, and what arms have lain <br>
        Under my head till morning; but the rain <br>
        Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh <br>
        Upon the glass and listen for reply, <br>
        And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain <br>
        For unremembered lads that not again <br>
        Will turn to me at midnight with a cry. <br>
        Thus in winter stands the lonely tree, <br>
        Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one, <br>
        Yet knows its boughs more silent than before: <br>
        I cannot say what loves have come and gone, <br>
        I only know that summer sang in me <br>
        A little while, that in me sings no more.<br>
