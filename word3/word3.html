        Come my cantilations,<br>
        Let us dump our hatreds into one bunch and be done with them,<br>
        Hot sun, clear water, fresh wind,<br>
        Let me be free of pavements,<br>
        Let me be free of the printers.<br>
        Let come beautiful people<br>
        Wearing raw silk of good colour,<br>
        Let come the graceful speakers,<br>
        Let come the ready of wit,<br>
        Let come the gay of manner, the insolent and the exulting.<br>
        We speak of burnished lakes,<br>
        And of dry air, as clear as metal.<br><br>
        -Ezra Pound <i> Come My Cantilations</i>
